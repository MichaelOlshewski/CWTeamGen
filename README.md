## __Description__
CWTeamGen is a NodeCLI application that takes input from a user, starting with creating a team, and adding a manager, the user will then proceed to add as many engineer's and intern's as needed. The application will automatically accept links and input them into an auto-generated HTML file with the name of the team.

## __Installation__
Once you download or clone the repo, open the main directory of the app in Terminal or Bash, you will need to run `npm install` inside the terminal to download the required dependencies, run `npm test` to make sure that all tests pass prior to running the application. Once all tests passes, you can run `node app.js`. Follow the prompts to automatically generate your team's page!

## __How To Use__
Run `node app.js` and follow the prompts. Once done adding engineer's and intern's, select 'No, the team is complete' from the choices under 'Would you like to add another team member?'. Upon doing so, it will automatically create a HTML file with your teams name as the file name.
